        <ul>
            <li>The quiz contains a series of multiple-choice questions, with a time limit of 10 seconds for each question.</li>
            <li>Users will receive one point for each correct answer. Users can see their score at the end of the quiz.</li>
            <li>If you want to retake the quiz, click on the restart button at the end of the quiz.</li>
            <li>Each question has a time limit of 10 seconds. If a user does not answer the question within the time limit, the quiz will move to the next question automatically.</li>
            <li>Once the user has answered the current question, they can click on the 'NEXT' button to move on to the next question.</li>
            <li>The quiz questions are generated randomly from a pool of questions. The order of the questions and the options for each question are randomized.</li>
            <li>After the user selects an option for a question, the app will check if the option is correct or not. If the option is correct, the app will display a green highlight around the option. If the option is incorrect, the app will display a red highlight around the option, and also show the correct answer.</li>
            <li>You may click 'START QUIZ' to begin.</li>
